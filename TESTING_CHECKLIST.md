# SSO Testing Checklist

## Current Status

✅ **Enterprise SSO restriction removed** - Pushed to GitHub  
⏳ **Application starting** - Background process running  
⏳ **Testing needed** - You to verify it works

## What to Test Now

### 1. Verify Application is Running
- Go to: http://localhost:3004 (or check your terminal for the port)
- You should see the StartNoo CRM login page

### 2. Log In to Your Workspace
- Use your existing credentials
- Access your workspace

### 3. Check SSO Availability
Navigate to:
- **Settings** → **Security** → **SSO**

You should now see:
- ✅ SSO configuration options (previously locked)
- ✅ Ability to add SAML or OIDC providers
- ✅ No "Enterprise feature" error

### 4. What You Need from Google

Before configuring SSO, you need from Google Admin Console:

1. **SAML SSO URL**: `https://accounts.google.com/o/saml2?idpid=...`
2. **Certificate**: x.509 certificate
3. **Issuer**: SAML entity ID

### 5. Configure Google Workspace SSO

**In Google Workspace Admin:**
1. Go to: https://admin.google.com
2. Security → SSO with third party IdP
3. Set up SSO app
4. Configure:
   - ACS URL: `http://localhost:3000/auth/saml/login/{your-provider-id}`
   - Entity ID: `twenty`
   - Name ID: Email

**In Twenty (Your Local App):**
1. Settings → Security → SSO
2. Click "Add Identity Provider"
3. Select "SAML"
4. Fill in:
   - Name: "Google Workspace"
   - Issuer: From Google
   - SSO URL: From Google
   - Certificate: From Google

## Next Steps Summary

### Immediate (Testing)
1. ✅ Confirm app is running locally
2. ⏳ Verify SSO options appear in Settings
3. ⏳ Get Google Workspace SAML config
4. ⏳ Configure SSO in the app
5. ⏳ Test SSO login

### Later (Production)
1. Deploy customized version to AWS
2. Update Google SSO ACS URL for production
3. Share with your team

## What Changed

**File Modified**: `packages/twenty-server/src/engine/core-modules/sso/services/sso.service.ts`

**Change**: Removed the billing check that blocked SSO for non-enterprise users

**Result**: SSO is now available to all users in your fork!

## Important Notes

### Your Independence
- ✅ You control this code (your GitHub fork)
- ✅ Twenty cannot force changes
- ✅ You choose what updates to pull
- ✅ This SSO unlock is **your feature** now

### Testing Approach
1. **Local first**: Test everything locally before deploying
2. **Google SSO second**: Configure SAML in Google + Twenty
3. **AWS last**: Deploy when confident

### Deployment Status
- **AWS currently**: Running official Twenty image (without your changes)
- **To deploy your changes**: Need to build custom Docker image or deploy directly
- **Timeline**: Can do this once local testing is complete

## Ready for Production?

When you've:
- ✅ Tested SSO locally
- ✅ Confirmed it works
- ✅ Configured Google Workspace

Then we can deploy your customized version to AWS!
